Containerized No-IP DDNS update requests
----------------------------------------

This repo produces a simple Docker image you can stand up that will continually update your public IP in No-IP.

To get up-and-running, take a look at [`./scripts/build.sh`](./scripts/build.sh) and [`./scripts/run-local-container.sh`](./scripts/run-local-container.sh) for examples. Some environment variables are required.
